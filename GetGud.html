            <p>
                It is really important to have a good cs, in order to get more gold and being able to get more items in order to get stronger.
                <br><br>
                There are different minion types, caster minions, mele minions, canon minions and super minions. <br>
                Caster minions are easiest to kill because they have least dmg and least hp. <br>
                Mele minions do more dmg and on their name they are melex, which leads them to have more hp and being harder to kill.<br>
                Canon minions deals more dmg due to them having a canon and they have most hp, they also give most gold on being killed, but they get changed to super minions if an ally/enemy inhibitor is destroyed.<br>
                Super minions are the strongest and tankiest mionions, which only spawn if an inhibitor is destroyed.

            <p>
                It is really improtant to play as a team in order to be able to make plays so you can win teamfights, objectives or just to be able to destroy the enemies tower/inhibitor/nexus.
